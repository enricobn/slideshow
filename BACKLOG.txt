DOING
------
- resolution independent:
  - scale the image to fit the screen

NEXT
-----
- the velocity should be independent of the refresh rate
- center images when do not fit the grid
- add more types off effects
- make Grid a trait and the actual grid ColorGrid
- I don't like QuadSide name and use, it's not clear what it means

BUGS
-----
- I have to force x11-dl = "=2.18.3" in cargo.toml otherwise I get an  "Illegal instruction" error
  - to enable core dump I have done:
    - ulimit -c unlimited
